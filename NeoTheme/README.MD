# NeoTheme (Originally: NewTheme)

My personal Fluxbox theme, heavily inspired by late 90s/early 2000s user interfaces. It comes in two flavors: The original "Blueberry" one, and the more polished and elegant "Tacuba". I recommend setting pseudotransparency to 230.

It requires Oldschool PC Font Pack and GNUstep GTK Iconpack for the best experience. You might need to edit the style file depending on your distro.
